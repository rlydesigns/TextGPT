# TextGPT
TextGPT is a project that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language generation model and Twilio's messaging API to allow users to send text messages and receive responses generated by GPT-3. 

The use case for this application is for the following types of users:
> - Those with limited access to internet or a computer, but access to SMS or a phone. 
> - Those who do not prefer to use ChatGPT via browser and prefer the convenience of a cell-phone. 
> - Those who are hesitant to use ChatGPT due to data privacy and security concerns.
